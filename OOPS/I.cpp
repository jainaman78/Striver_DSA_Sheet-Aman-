/*
    I: Interface Segregation Principle
    do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them
    Let’s understand Interface Segregation Principle using an example:

    Suppose if you enter a restaurant and you are pure vegetarian. 
    The waiter in that restaurant gave you the menu card which includes vegetarian items, non-vegetarian items, drinks, and sweets.
    In this case, as a customer, you should have a menu card which includes only vegetarian items,
    not everything which you don’t eat in your food. Here the menu should be different for different types of customers.
    The common or general menu card for everyone can be divided into multiple cards instead of just one.
    Using this principle helps in reducing the side effects and frequency of required changes.
